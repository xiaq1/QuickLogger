TODO List for Logger

1. simpilify the usage of loggerLoadIniFile() to make it more ease to
   use the console as terminal:

   Currently we can use example/example_ini.ini  as the first argument of  loggerLoadIniFil()

2. Debug the issue that application may core if 'file' rather than 'console'
   is used as the output

3. Support the requirement to support DIY level to enable debug specific component.

4. update changelevel.sh to make it much easier to be used.
